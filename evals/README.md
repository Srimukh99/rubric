# evals

Reproducible checks of what the rubric tooling claims. They test the scripts,
not agent behaviour: the cheating diffs and agent mistakes are scripted.

| Eval | Run | Result at v0.7 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Layout integrity | `python3 tools/check_layout.py` | 17 scripts each in one skill and mentioned; no dangling path or retired name |
| Routing, v0.5 layout vs v0.6 layout | `python3 evals/routing.py` (add `--held-out` once, never tune on it) | dev 90% to 98% top-1, 100% top-3; every v0.5 trigger still routes (100%) |
| Delegation: trust vs old rules vs contract-first | `python3 evals/delegation.py` (`-v` for the full log) | original contract tests passing 2 / 7 / 8 of 8; bad changes landed 4 / 1 / 0 |
| Tamper guard | `python3 evals/tamper_guard.py` | 19 of 19 cheats flagged (15 as FAIL); 0 of 12 honest changes failed |
| Passing tests vs real checks | `sh evals/mutation/run.sh` | weak suite 24% (8 of 33 bugs caught), strong suite 100% (33 of 33); both suites pass |
| ratchet vs naive gate | `python3 evals/ratchet_vs_naive.py` | ratchet 7 of 7 correct; naive gate 2 of 7 |
| Guidance coverage and defect reachability | `python3 evals/guidance_coverage.py` | rubric 6/6 core, 2/4 extended, 10/10 defects reachable; superpowers 2/6, 1/4, 3/10 |
| Code quality: does a green suite mean correct code? | `python3 evals/code_quality.py` (`-v` to name each hidden failure) | 6 of 6 candidates pass their own suite; 3 are wrong; 10 hidden defects would have shipped. Mutation score does **not** separate them |
| Claim guard: unproven "done" claims, named vs. stopped | `python3 evals/claim_guard.py` (`--lib NAME=PATH` to score another library) | Stop hook stops 16 of 19 (9 of the first 12); 0 of 6 honest closings blocked, no loop |

Every row above was re-run at v0.7. `delegation.py`, `ratchet_vs_naive.py` and
`mutation/run.sh` need `pytest` (mutation also needs `hypothesis`) and print a
`SKIPPED` line and exit 0 when it is missing. The held-out routing figure
(71% to 73% when first measured) has **not** been re-measured since the v0.7
description tightening: that set is frozen on purpose, so re-run it deliberately
rather than as part of a loop.

Token savings from `loop.py` (pytest, 153 tests): ~513 tokens raw to ~129 with 2 failures
(all values and file:line kept); ~1,958 to ~199 with 12 failures (all 12 named).

Still missing: a with-and-without comparison of real agents on real tasks.
That needs a model API key; contributions welcome.

## Code quality eval: a negative result worth keeping

`code_quality.py` gives three tasks a `visible` suite of the kind an implementer
writes from the spec, and a `hidden` acceptance suite they never see. Each task
has a thin candidate and a solid one. Both pass the visible suite.

Two findings, and the second one is inconvenient:

**A green suite carries no information about correctness.** All six candidates
pass their own tests; three are wrong, with 10 hidden failures between them.
That is the same point `mutation/run.sh` makes, from the other direction.

**Mutation score does not predict correctness across implementations, and here
it is anti-correlated.** Thin candidates averaged 83%, solid ones 62%; in every
task the thin implementation scored at least as high.

| task | thin | solid |
| --- | --- | --- |
| discount | 100% | 93% |
| overlap | 50% | 33% |
| pagination | 100% | 60% |

The reason is structural: a thin implementation has fewer mutation sites, and
the visible suite covers a larger share of them. A solid implementation adds
guards - `max`, `min`, emptiness checks - that the visible suite never
exercises, so those mutants survive.

This does not invalidate `mutation/run.sh`. That eval holds one implementation
fixed and varies the suite, which is the question mutation testing answers:
*is my suite real?* `code_quality.py` varies the implementation and holds the
suite style fixed, asking *is my code right?* Mutation score does not answer
the second question, and a `--min` threshold on it will not catch a thin
implementation. Treat the score as a property of a suite, never as a grade for
the code.

What did separate thin from solid: nothing in the toolchain. Only the hidden
suite, which is to say only writing the boundary cases in the first place.
That is a guidance gap, not a tooling gap, and it is the target for the
reference-depth work in `docs/specs/2026-10-02-methodology-depth-design.md`.

## Guidance coverage: what the score does and does not mean

`code_quality.py` showed that no tool in the box separates a thin
implementation from a solid one. `guidance_coverage.py` measures the thing that
does: whether the advice given at the moment tests are written names each
defect class. Two scores, and the second is the honest one.

**Core classes** are derived from `code_quality.py`'s hidden suites. rubric
scores 6/6 against superpowers' 2/6 - but that taxonomy came from the same
three tasks the guidance was then written against, so read it as a floor on
what the guidance covers, not as a measure of breadth.

**Extended classes** are canonical categories *not* derived from those tasks:
null handling, large input, concurrency, locale. rubric scores 2/4 and
superpowers 1/4. That narrow lead is the trustworthy number.

**Defect reachability** is the third number and the one that answers the
original question. It runs the thin candidates, collects the hidden tests that
actually fail, and asks for each one whether a library's guidance points you at
it. rubric reaches 10 of 10, superpowers 3 of 10. The failing set is measured
on every run rather than hardcoded, and a stale mapping prints a warning and
fails `tests/test_guidance_coverage.py`.

Note what reachability does *not* fix: the classes still came from these three
tasks. It weights the score by real defects instead of class count, which is
better, but it cannot escape that circularity. The extended classes remain the
only un-circular comparison here.

Neither score says the guidance works. The metric checks that a class is
*named*, which is necessary and not sufficient; whether naming it changes what
an agent writes needs the agent comparison this directory still lacks.

The metric is gameable by listing keywords, so it prints the matched line for
every hit - read them. Six measurement defects were found and fixed while
building it, each of which would have changed the verdict: "Mock only slow or
external boundaries" scoring as boundary-value guidance, "improve beyond the
test" as out-of-range, "Partial mocks fail silently" as a partial last chunk,
`\bevery` matching "everything", a genuine superpowers line ("zero, empty, nil
... input") being missed, and - worst - a sentence saying locale is out of
scope scoring as locale coverage. `tests/test_guidance_coverage.py` keeps all
six fixed.

Concurrency and locale were deliberately left out of rubric's table rather
than added to raise the score; `prove-it.md` states why in the file.

## Claim guard: words and enforcement, measured apart

`claim_guard.py` scripts turns that end in a claim with nothing behind it: a
red-flag phrase ("should work", "I'm confident"), an excuse for skipping the
check ("it's one line", "a subagent said it was done"), or a plain success
claim the session's own actions do not back ("Done. All tests pass." with
nothing run). Three scores, and only the last two are worth much.

**Named** asks whether the completion guidance names the phrase or excuse.
rubric scores 19 of 19, which is close to meaningless on its own: the cases and
`receipts.md` were written together. It is kept as a regression guard. Its
patterns also follow rubric's wording, so a library that says the same thing
in other words is under-scored; read any cross-library comparison by hand.

**Repo** and **message** are measured by running `vibe_check.py --stop-hook`
with a real transcript on stdin, the way the harness calls it, and each catch
is credited to the check that made it. *Repo*: five cases plant a mistake (a
leftover `breakpoint()`, a key in a never-staged file, a `.env`, conflict
markers, a red suite) and run with the message checks off. *Message*: every
case runs on a clean repo, so only the transcript can trip the hook - the
red-flag wording, or success reported with no passing check after the last
edit.

| | stopped |
| --- | --- |
| the first 12 cases, written before the message checks | 9 of 12 (6 before the success check) |
| 7 cases written with the message checks | 7 of 7 - a floor, like `named` |
| 6 honest closings: a receipt after its check, a success claim after its check, quoting the red-flag words, saying what is left, reporting a failure, answering a question | 0 blocked |
| 12 real closing messages from the session that built this, replayed | 0 blocked |

The honest controls and the replay are what stop the message check from
"winning" by blocking everything. The replay found four false blocks in the
first version - a quoted `>` read as a redirect, a helper script written
outside the repo, and a rule that only credited checks from the same turn -
and each is now a test.

What no script stops: "I did everything that was asked", "CI will catch it",
"it worked when I ran it earlier". They assert nothing a transcript can
contradict, so the prose carries them. Two catches are weaker than they look:
`regression_unseen` and `subagent_said_done` are stopped because nothing ran,
not because the hook knows whether the test was seen failing or the diff was
read. An agent that runs a green suite gets both past it.

Comparing another library is `--lib NAME=PATH`; it scans the role-named
completion guidance under that library's `skills/` and prints which files it
read.

## Routing eval: what it is and is not

`routing.py` is a lexical stand-in (TF-IDF over skill names and descriptions) for an agent choosing a skill.
It is not a language model. It shows whether descriptions are distinctive and whether any trigger wording was
lost in a refactor; it cannot predict how a real agent behaves. `routing_cases.json` holds a `dev` set
(fine to tune against) and a `held_out` set (frozen: run it once, then write new cases rather than tuning on it).
Cases were written by the author, so treat absolute numbers loosely and compare layouts only.
